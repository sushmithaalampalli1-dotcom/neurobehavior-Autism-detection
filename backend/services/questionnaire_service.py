"""Questionnaire Assessment Service: Indian Autism Screening Questionnaire (IASQ).

Implements the official 10-item Indian Autism Screening Questionnaire (IASQ),
derived from the Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism (ISAA) by NIEPID / ICMR.

Standards:
- Fully independent of MRI deep learning model pipeline.
- Age eligibility: 3 to 18 years.
- 10 caregiver-report items (Yes / No).
- Strict missing-answer validation (all 10 items required).
- Documented cutoffs:
  * Cutoff >= 2: Primary clinical screening positive (Sens ~97%, Spec ~92%).
  * Cutoff >= 1: Community screening threshold (Sens ~97-99%, Spec ~62-81%).
  * Score 0: Screen negative.
- Authoritative reference: Mukherjee et al., Indian Autism Screening Questionnaire.
